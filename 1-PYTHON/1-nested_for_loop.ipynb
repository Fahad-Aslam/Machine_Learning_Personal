    "\n",
    "It's like putting a smaller loop inside a bigger loop. The bigger loop (outer loop) runs a certain number of times, and each time it runs, it completely executes the smaller loop (inner loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with Chocolate Box:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outer Loop (Big Box): This loop represents going through each chocolate in the big box.\n",
    "2. Inner Loop (Small Chocolates): This loop represents trying each sub-bars within each of the chocolate (pretend there are multiple bars in one chocolate!).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The outer loop runs 3 times (number of chocolates).\n",
    "2. Inside each chocolate (iteration), the inner loop runs 3 times (number of flavors).\n",
    "3. So, it prints \"Opening Chocolate...\" and then \"Trying flavor...\" for each flavor, 3 times in total.\n",
    "4. You can then ask your friend's opinion and react accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The inner loop restarts completely for each outer loop iteration.\n",
    "- You can use variables like chocolate and flavor inside the loops to keep track of your position.\n",
