    "#### Basic Slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a NumPy array as a loaf of bread, with each element like an individual piece. You can use square brackets [] and colons : to select specific parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting a single element**: arr[index]. \n",
    "- Just like picking one slice, you provide the index of the element you want (remember indexing starts from 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting a range of elements**: arr[start:stop]. \n",
    "- This gets a continuous sequence of elements, similar to taking multiple slices in a row. Here, start indicates the index of the first element to include (inclusive), and stop indicates the index of the element to exclude (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting all elements up to a certain point**: arr[:stop].\n",
    "- If you omit the starting index, it defaults to the beginning (index 0). So, arr[:4] selects the first four elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting all elements from a certain point onwards:** arr[start:]. \n",
    "- If you omit the ending index, it selects everything up to the end. So, arr[3:] selects elements from index 3 to the end.\n",
